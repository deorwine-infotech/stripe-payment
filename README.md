## Project Name

React Stripe Checkout

## About Project

Stripe's Checkout makes it almost too easy to take people's money. This should make it even easier if you're building a react application.

Stripe Checkout provides a simple solution to accept payments. This solution will generate a payment form for you based on how you configure it.
In order to use Stripe, you’ll need to create a free account or use an existing one. Register to create a Stripe account.

Once you have successfully submitted the registration form, you’ll be sent an email to confirm your email address and you should be redirected to the dashboard.

In the side navigation, click Developers followed by API keys. The API keys page will list your publishable key and your secret key. You’ll need the publishable key when configuring react-stripe-checkout.
